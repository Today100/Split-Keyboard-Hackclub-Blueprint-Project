# Split-Keyboard-Hackclub-Blueprint-Project
A split keyboard using the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840. Inspired by my dad, who likes looking at different kinds of keyboards. I'd like to make one to practice my skills in hardware design and give it to him as a gift. It has a Bluetooth feature and is rechargeable.
